# Face Detection

This project is designed to detect objects from images , webcam or recorded videos.It uses machine learning algorithms and open-source library to extract features of objects. It gather the data , performs data preprocessing , trains the model and performs model evaluation.

# Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

This is a POC(Proof of concept) kind-of project. The data used here comes up with no guarantee from the creator. So, don't use it for making decisions. If you do so, the creator is not responsible for anything. However, this project presents the idea that how we can use MACHINE LEARNING can recognize faces in photos or videos, making it useful for things like security, unlocking phones, or tagging friends in social media posts.

# Introduction

Face detection is a technology that identifies and locates human faces in images or videos. It's commonly used in security systems, photography apps, and social media platforms for tasks like recognizing people, applying filters, or enhancing photo organization. This technology enables automatic detection and analysis of faces, making various applications more convenient and efficient.

# Installation

git clone 

Install the required dependencies using pip: pip install opencv-python

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to train models and make predictions.

# Dataset 
Images from datasets , webcam and recorded videos are used. This project contains various objects in it.

# Pre-trained Model
Haarcascade_frontalface.xml
